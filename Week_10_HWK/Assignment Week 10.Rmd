### Sentiment Analysis

#### In *Text Mining with R*, Chapter 2 looks at Sentiment Analysis. In this assignment, you should start by getting the primary example code from chapter 2 working in an R Markdown document. You should provide a citation to this base code. You're then asked to entend the code in two ways:

* Work with a different corpus of your choosing, and 
* Incorporate at least one additional sentiment lexicon (possibly from another R package that you've found through research).
